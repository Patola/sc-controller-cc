## Features
- Allows to setup, configure and use the Steam Controller without ever launching Steam
- Connect multiple controllers at the same time, each with its own remembered profile
- Supports profiles switchable in GUI or with controller button
- Stick, Pads and Gyroscope input
- Steam Controller 2 (2026) support, including its capacitive stick-touch and grip sensors — bind actions to them directly, or use them as conditions in mode-shift combinations
- Haptic Feedback and in-game Rumble support
- OSD, Menus, On-Screen Keyboard for desktop *and* in games.
- Automatic profile switching based on active window.
- Macros, button cycling, rapid fire, modeshift, mouse regions, …
- Emulates Xbox360 controller, mouse, trackball and keyboard.

Based on [Standalone Steam Controller Driver](https://github.com/ynsta/steamcontroller) by [Ynsta](https://github.com/ynsta).

## Using multiple controllers

SC Controller can drive several controllers at once — Steam Controllers (v1 and
v2), a DualShock 4 and others can all be connected together.

- **One window, two bars: pick the controller, then its profile.** Just connect
  them: a controller-selector bar lists every connected controller (by type,
  numbered when you have more than one of the same model) together with its
  current profile; choosing one shows it on the big controller image, and a
  second bar sets that controller's profile. There is no separate window per
  device. The controller that connected *first* is the primary one — it is the
  one drawn by default and the target when a command (a menu, the OSD) does not
  name a specific controller.
- **Each controller keeps its own profile.** Selecting a controller and setting
  a profile applies only to that controller. The choice is remembered and
  restored automatically the next time that controller connects, so you do not
  have to re-pick it every session.
- **Disconnecting is safe.** Turning one controller off (or letting it go idle)
  leaves the window and the other controllers untouched; when it comes back it
  returns to its remembered profile.

*Two Steam Controller v1s and a Steam Controller v2 connected at once: the
selector at the top lists each controller — numbered when there are duplicates —
alongside its current profile.*

### Telling controllers apart

How a controller is identified — and therefore which remembered profile and
per-controller settings it gets — is governed by **Use Serial Numbers to
Identify Controllers** in *Settings*:

- **Off (default):** controllers are identified by connection order (first
  connected, second connected, …). This is simplest for a fixed setup, but if
  you change which controller powers on first they will swap profiles.
- **On:** each controller is identified by its own hardware serial number, so
  its profile and settings follow the physical device no matter what order
  things connect in.

Turn this **on** when you regularly use more than one controller — especially
two of the same model, such as two Steam Controllers — and want each to reliably
keep its own profile.

## Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/sc-controller.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/sc-controller/versions)

Linux:
  - **Arch Linux:** Found in official [extra](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sc-controller/) repository and [AUR/sc-controller-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sc-controller-git/)
  - **Ubuntu (22.04-jammy, 24.04-noble):** Packaged as AppImage in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases), ***which may also run fine on other operating systems - jammy image is currently the most compatible one***
  - **Gentoo:** Packaged as [game-util/sc-controller](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-util/sc-controller)
  - **Void Linux:** Packaged as [sc-controller](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/sc-controller/template) - Run `xbps-install -S sc-controller` in a terminal, points to archived Ryochan7's fork at the time of writing
  - **Others:** You can attempt to use one of the AppImages (try all, AppImages built on older distributions tend to work better), or a package meant for your parent distribution if applicable. Flatpak is planned.

### AppImage: install the udev rules

The AppImage is self-contained but **cannot install the udev rules** it needs (those live in a system directory). Without them your user can't access the controller and SC Controller can't create the virtual gamepad (`/dev/uinput`), so a detected controller appears to "do nothing". Distro packages install these rules for you; **AppImage users must do it once, by hand:**

1. Download `69-sc-controller.rules` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Patola/sc-controller-cc/releases/latest).
2. Copy it into place — this needs `sudo`:
   ```sh
   sudo cp 69-sc-controller.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/69-sc-controller.rules
   ```
3. Reload and re-apply the rules:
   ```sh
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
   ```
4. Unplug and replug the controller (or its wireless dongle) — or reboot.

Only the AppImage needs this; the Arch and other distro packages already ship these rules. **The Steam Deck doesn't need it either** — SteamOS already ships udev rules for Steam devices, so the AppImage works out of the box there.

Windows:
  - It should be possible to get it running as per the [wiki](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/wiki/Running-SC-Controller-on-Windows), but this is untested and might be broken, report a bug if so

### Via Python into a local build directory
  - ~~Download and extract [latest release](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases/latest)~~ .zip releases without .git directory are currently broken - tracked in [#50](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/issues/50)
  - Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller.git` and navigate into it: `cd sc-controller`
  - `python3 -m build --wheel`
  - `python3 -m installer --destdir="./build" dist/*.whl`
  - Run the app via: `SCC_SHARED="${PWD}" PYTHONPATH="./build/usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages" PATH="${PWD}/build/usr/bin:${PATH}" ./build/usr/bin/sc-controller`

### Via Docker
A test build with Docker can be created using the following way:

```bash
docker build -o build-output --build-arg BASE_CODENAME=noble .
```

### Via Python venv through run.sh
  - ~~Download and extract [latest release](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases/latest)~~ .zip releases without .git directory are currently broken - tracked in [#50](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/issues/50)
  - Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller.git` and navigate into it: `cd sc-controller`
  - Optionally checkout a branch or a tag, like `python3`(default) or `v0.4.9.8.8`
  - Execute `./run.sh`, this automatically builds the project into a venv called `.env`, activates it and runs sc-controller, which in turn runs scc-daemon if one does not run already
  - If you are debugging an issue, running `./run.sh daemon` first will launch the daemon in debug mode, allowing you to launch sc-controller in another terminal with `./run.sh`
