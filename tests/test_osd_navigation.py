"""Menu navigation pacing.

StickController turns positions into repeated 'direction' signals. Menus accept
more than one input at once -- STICK, plus the d-pad, which arrives as LEFT on a
DualShock 4 and as DPAD on an SC2 -- and they all feed one controller.

Sharing it naively breaks in a way that looks like two unrelated bugs: nudging
the stick scrolls far too fast, and holding it fully deflected stops the list
dead. Both come from the same place. _move() emits on every direction change and
cancels the repeat timer whenever the direction reaches zero, so an idle input
reporting (0, 0) cancels the repeat the stick is driving. Movement then happens
only on changes -- once per event, at the controller's report rate -- and stops
entirely as soon as the stick is held still and stops producing events.

Needs Gtk for the GObject signal; run under xvfb-run on a headless machine.
