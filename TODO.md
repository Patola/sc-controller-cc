List of (possibly) planned features in no particular order:

- GTK3 -> GTK4 port (evaluated 2026-07, NOT urgent). The original driver for
  this -- "the OSD cannot draw over fullscreen games on Wayland" -- turned out
  to be a layer-shell layer choice, fixed in GTK3 (OSD now uses layer OVERLAY;
  see scc/osd/__init__.py _default_layer). Note gtk4-layer-shell would NOT have
  helped by itself: it speaks the same zwlr_layer_shell_v1 protocol, so it works
  on KDE/wlroots and fails on GNOME/Mutter exactly as the GTK3 version does.
  Scope if/when it happens: ~15.6k lines scc/gui + 5.0k lines scc/osd, plus 31
  glade files (18.5k lines XML, all gtk+ 3.24). Work areas, roughly in size
  order:
    - glade -> GTK4 builder XML: gtk4-builder-tool simplify --3to4 does the
      bulk, but 12 GtkMenu + 47 GtkMenuItem need a real rewrite to GMenu /
      GtkPopoverMenu, plus GtkAlignment (2), GtkToolbar (2), GtkColorButton
      (13) and child-properties -> layout-properties over 64 grids / 95 boxes.
      There is no Glade for GTK4; the editor is Cambalache;
    - container/visibility sweep: ~190 sites (121 add(, 49 pack_start, 22
      show_all) -- mechanical, high volume;
    - scc/gui/svg_widget.py is the riskiest single piece: it subclasses the
      removed Gtk.EventBox and uses motion-notify/button-press events, and it
      backs both the main editor and four OSD modules -> rewrite on
      GtkDrawingArea/GtkPicture + GtkGestureClick + GtkEventControllerMotion;
    - OSD windows can REGRESS on X11: GTK4 removed set_type_hint,
      set_keep_above, stick and set_wmclass, which are exactly the fallback
      used when layer-shell is unavailable; keeping parity needs Gdk.X11Surface
      plus raw Xlib property setting. The Wayland side is a near 1:1
      gtk-layer-shell -> gtk4-layer-shell swap;
    - Gtk.StatusIcon (2 sites) is gone -> AppIndicator/SNI only;
      Gdk.Screen (7 sites) -> GdkDisplay/GdkMonitor.
  Estimate ~25-40 focused days plus a cross-compositor/multi-controller test
  pass. The 7 OSD binaries are separate processes, so a phased port (OSD first,
  GUI still GTK3) is possible -- blocked only by the shared svg_widget and
  daemon_manager. NOT part of this: the nine modules coupled to Xlib via
  scc/lib/xwrappers (pointer position, XKB for the OSK, window-title detection
  for the autoswitcher) are broken on Wayland regardless of toolkit version and
  need per-compositor work (KWin DBus/scripting, wlr-foreign-toplevel).

- Fix the TRIXIE AppImage segfault on newest-glibc distros. The
  debian-trixie-based AppImage (a CI artifact; releases ship the jammy pair)
  segfaults (SIGSEGV, exit 245) during AppRun dependency-check when run on
  Ubuntu resolute / Fedora 43 / Fedora 44 containers, while passing on
  jammy/noble/bookworm/trixie itself. Reproduce with
  AppImageBuilder.test.Dockerfile against those bases. Until fixed, those
  three test-matrix entries are marked experimental (continue-on-error) in
  .github/workflows/appimage.yml so they don't block releases.

- Selectable output device: virtual Xbox (today's default), virtual DS4/DS5,
  or NO virtual controller at all. The current "Xbox 360 pad" is just a
  generic uinput device wearing an X360 identity defined entirely in
  config["output"] (scc/config.py: vendor/product/name/buttons/axes), so the
  architecture already treats identity as data. Three tiers of work:
    - no-controller mode (keyboard+mouse only) ALREADY EXISTS as the
      undocumented SCC_NOGAMEPAD env var (scc/mapper.py create_gamepad);
      promote it to a config key + GUI toggle (trivial), or per-profile
      (moderate: create/destroy the uinput gamepad on profile switch).
      Essential for games that refuse mouse/keyboard input while any
      controller is detected;
    - evdev-level DS4/DS5 identity presets (Sony VID/PID + the button/axis
      layout SDL's gamecontrollerdb expects on the classic path): preset
      table + GUI dropdown; gives PlayStation glyphs in most games, but no
      gyro/touchpad/lightbar (those ride on hidraw, which uinput cannot
      fake; SDL HIDAPI just falls back to evdev);
    - faithful DS4/DS5 emulation via /dev/uhid: present a real HID device so
      the kernel's hid-playstation binds and exposes motion/touchpad nodes
      -> native in-game gyro from ANY supported controller. Big: a uhid
      backend beside uinput, authentic report descriptors/streams, a udev
      rule for /dev/uhid. Prior art exists (fake-DS4-over-uhid projects).

- DualShock 4 / DualSense (ds4/ds5) polish. The HID driver is now functional
  (mapper rstick/dpad guards, touchpad coordinate scaling + click highlight), but
  rough edges remain:
    - the two analog sticks are asymmetric in Input Test -- the left and right
      stick brighten / behave differently from each other;
    - the input icons drawn around the controller are the generic ones, not the
      DualShock face symbols (cross / circle / square / triangle);
    - the DS4 gyro works as relative and absolute (host-side euler integration in
      _step_orientation, verified on hardware) but the absolute path is gyro-only,
      so it DRIFTS and gimbals on large combined rotations. The clean next step is
      accelerometer drift-correction: fuse gyro + accel (complementary filter) to
      pin pitch/roll to the gravity vector -- the raw accel is still in q1-q3 right
      after decode, before _step_orientation overwrites them (yaw has no absolute
      reference without a magnetometer, so it drifts inherently);
    - gyro -> MOUSE routes to the stick instead: an Axes/Rels IntEnum value
      collision (ABS_X == REL_X) makes a mouse axis serialize/round-trip as a stick
      axis. The gyro editor labels + chooser display are fixed, but the save/reload
      path still needs a proper Axes-vs-Rels disambiguation; use gamepad axes for
      gyro meanwhile;
    - no rumble: neither DS4Controller nor DS4HidRawController drives the pad (the
      DS5 driver does) -- port the DS5/kernel output report; over Bluetooth the
      DS4HidRawController is input-only, so rumble + lightbar there need output
      reports with the BT CRC32 wrapper (mirror DS5HidRawController);
    - the lightbar LED is not driven (no DS4-specific set_led);
    - DS5 is UNVERIFIED (no DualSense hardware here): its HID touchpad scaling was
      added by analogy to the DS4 (DualSense pad assumed 1920x1080) and not tested;
      the DS5HidRawController touchpad is still unscaled and stores cpad as unsigned
      c_uint16, which can't hold the signed scaled range -- it needs a field type
      change as well as scaling.
- Multiple on-screen menus (and possibly keyboards) when using multiple controllers
- Injecting emulated xbox controller into wine
- mnuImage right-click "change background" menu has no `sc2` entry (the v2
  image is selected automatically via sc2.config.json `gui.background`, but
  it can't be picked manually from that menu yet).
- Custom small (24px) controller icons per supported controller. Today only the
  Steam Controller v1 (sc-*) and v2 (sc2-*) have bespoke top-down glyphs; every
  other type (deck, ds4, ds5, evdev, hid, scbt, fake) reuses the same generic
  silhouette, just recolored. Draw a distinct glyph per type so each controller
  is recognisable at a glance. The v2 glyph could also be refined further (its
  trackpads are necessarily small at 24px).
- Steam Controller v1 GET_SERIAL reliability (nicety). The flaky v1 serial read
  is now handled gracefully - usb.py retries a stalled control request instead of
  tearing the dongle down, and sc_dongle falls back to a generated id if it never
  reads - so multiple v1s with "Use Serial Numbers" on are detected reliably.
  Remaining nicety: investigate *why* GET_SERIAL stalls, so a v1 always ends up
  with its real serial (today a persistent stall yields a positional id instead).
- Continuous "HD rumble" for the Steam Controller v2 (and v1/Deck). The SC pads
  are LRA voice-coil actuators, not ERM spin-motors. We already drive single
  pulses (v1: FEEDBACK report 0x8F; v2: interrupt-OUT report 0x82, effect 0x01 =
  one click) which suit pad/scroll detents but NOT sustained, amplitude/
  frequency-modulated game rumble. Gap: the v2's continuous-rumble report is
  unknown (see sc2.py feedback(): "sustained game rumble may need another report,
  not yet found"); the v2 uses its own report scheme (interrupt-OUT 0x82),
  distinct from the Deck's feature-report commands, so it needs confirming for
  the v2 specifically. Approach (do NOT brute-force the HID space by trial and
  error - a wrong report just does nothing and gives no signal):
    1. Read the canonical implementations: SDL's hidapi Steam driver
       (SDL_hidapi_steam.c / SDL_hidapi_steamdeck.c - ID_TRIGGER_RUMBLE_CMD plus
       the left/right gain "magic numbers") and the Linux kernel
       drivers/hid/hid-steam.c (FF play_effect, derived from SDL's Deck code).
    2. Check first whether SDL3 already rumbles the v2 by its VID/PID - if so,
       its source *is* the v2 report format and no capture is needed.
    3. Otherwise capture ground truth: run Steam Input on the v2, trigger rumble
       (Steam's controller rumble test, or a rumbling game) and capture the USB
       OUTPUT reports with usbmon + Wireshark; decode the continuous-rumble
       report Steam actually sends.
    4. Replicate it in sc2.py feedback() and diff the emitted bytes against the
       capture to confirm.
    5. Map the emulated gamepad's FF_RUMBLE strong/weak magnitudes to the LRA's
       amplitude/frequency/gain and tune for feel (LRA != ERM, so a curve is
       needed).
  Plumbing already exists (emulated gamepad FF -> controller.feedback()); the
  missing piece is the v2 continuous-rumble report itself. Refs: SDL hidapi steam
  driver, kernel hid-steam.c, and Alice Mikhaylenko's "Steam Deck, HID, and
  libmanette adventures" writeup.
- Deck OSD menu fixes. (a) "Display Current Bindings..." and "Run Program..."
  ship disabled in the menu settings; once enabled they appear in the OSD, but
  selecting them does nothing - their shell() actions (scc-osd-show-bindings,
  scc-osd-launcher) don't actually run/work on the Deck. Make them functional.
  (b) Remove "Turn Controller OFF" from the Deck's OSD menu - the Deck's
  built-in controller can't be powered off (today it shows and does nothing).
  Entries defined in scc/gui/global_settings.py (~L45-58, e.g.
  "Turn Controller OFF" -> osd(turnoff())); menu data in
  default_menus/Default.menu.
- Generalize the OSD "Turn Controller OFF" hiding. It's currently hidden only
  for the Deck's built-in controls (controller type == "deck", checked in
  scc/osd/menu.py against the --controller-type the daemon passes). Replace that
  hardcoded type check with a per-controller capability (a ControllerFlags bit or
  a controller.can_turnoff()) so any controller that can't be powered off
  remotely hides the entry, not just the Deck.
- Deck tray/status icon not visible. On the Steam Deck the status (tray) icon
  doesn't appear even with the option enabled - works on desktop now that
  libdbusmenu is bundled, so this is a Deck/gamescope SNI-tray-host issue to
  investigate.
- Rebrand the AppImage desktop app-id. app_info.id in AppImageBuilder.yml /
  AppImageBuilder.debian.yml is still org.c0rn3j.sc-controller (upstream), so the
  installed .desktop carries the upstream id, and the after_bundle step symlinks
  it as org.c0rn3j.sc-controller.desktop. Switch both to org.patola.sc-controller-cc
  once the fork is stable and we have committed/PR'd to upstream.
- Replace the last deprecated GTK stock-icon calls. macro_editor.py (the
  up/down/delete buttons) and modeshift_editor.py (the clear button) still call
  `Gtk.Image.new_from_stock("gtk-go-up" / "gtk-go-down" / "gtk-delete", ...)`.
  They render today (GTK maps the stock id to an icon internally) but the stock
  API is deprecated; move them to `Gtk.Image.new_from_icon_name` with freedesktop
  names (go-up / go-down / edit-delete, or the -symbolic variants - all present in
  Adwaita/Breeze). Same class as the profile_switcher.py save/edit buttons, which
  were actively blank because `new_from_icon_name` was handed the stock ids
  "gtk-save"/"gtk-edit" (now document-save / document-edit).

Hard stuff:
- Injecting emulated xbox controller into PlayOnLinux

Very hard stuff:
- Visual feedback in binding editor ( [what this guy says](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/5pcdmr/sc_controller_use_steam_controller_without_steam/dcqpvf4/) )

**Done** stuff:
- "Act on release" (inverted button): a general InvertedButtonModifier plus a
  checkbox in the button action editor (next to Toggle/Repeat) that fires a
  binding on *release* instead of press - for always-on sensors like the
  capacitive grips. Round-trips with the Custom Action `inverted(...)` token.
- Dedicated v2 controller artwork: traced SVG (tools/sc2-source.svg) wired by
  tools/gen_sc2_image.py into controller-images/sc2.svg + v2 face-overlay
  glyphs (button-images/sc2_*.svg, lifted from the drawn symbols so the face
  buttons are blank in the art -> no duplication, monochrome ABXY, round Steam,
  single dots) + v2 side-panel icons (images/sc2/*.svg, per-controller override
  added in app.apply_gui_config_buttons). Control-name ids on sticks/pads/dpad/
  bumpers + grip-touch shapes so everything highlights on hover; darker body
  (#b8b8b8). sc2.config.json points at it all. Replaces the borrowed Deck image.
- Multicontroller support
- Per-controller profile memory: each controller's profile is remembered by id
  (config["controllers"][id]["profile"]) and restored on (re)connect - follows
  the physical device with "Use Serial Numbers" on, per-slot otherwise.
- Configurable gamepad type (e.g. 4 axes and 16 buttons)
- Steam Profile import
- Radial Menu for the Joystick/Trackpad
- Copy & paste
- Cycling Buttons
- Process monitor (or active window monitor) with switch
- Mouse regions
- Touch-Menu
- Menu in OSD
- OSD
- double click
- on-screen keyboard
- Spining mouse wheel rotation
- Haptic feedback support
- Gyroscope input
- Gamepad button as modifier (modeshift)
- Macros
- Turbo
- Trigger settings
- DPAD that acts only when clicked
- 8-way DPAD
- Selector for media keys

## SC2 actuator audio streaming (haptic reports 0x86-0x89)

The v2's haptic actuators can be driven as speakers: reports 0x86-0x89 carry
stream configuration plus PCM / u-law data (layouts from iczero's RE, collected
in CouchTurtle/sc2-research; not verified here, and not present in SDL3).

This is the one piece of the haptic family that needs design rather than just
wiring, because nothing in sc-controller has a concept of a *stream*. Every
haptic today is a fire-and-forget event attached to an action. Streaming needs
a source (file? synthesised? routed from the system mixer?), buffering and
timing against the USB endpoint, and some answer to what a *profile* would even
store. Deferred until there is a reason to want it beyond completeness.

Prerequisites: the simpler effects (0x83 tone / 0x84 sweep / 0x85 script) land
first, since they settle how per-effect parameters are represented in
HapticData and in the GUI.

## Haptic feedback on button presses

feedback() is offered by ten actions -- XY, ball, circular, circularabs, dpad,
hipfire, menu, mouse, trackpad, trigger -- but NOT by button. Haptics were
conceived upstream as continuous feedback tied to movement (pad-travel ticks,
trackball detents) rather than a per-press buzz, so ButtonAction never grew
set_haptic.

On the v2 that reads as a gap: a button press producing a tick is exactly what
the hardware is for, and it is what makes the pads feel like buttons already.

Deferred deliberately. Adding MOD_FEEDBACK to ButtonAction changes which
modifiers the editor offers for buttons on EVERY controller, so the GUI side
is not a small change and it needs thinking about before it is worth doing --
what a v1 user is offered, whether the feedback panel makes sense next to a
button binding, and whether it should be per-press or press-and-release.

## Haptic feedback on the DS4

The DualShock 4 has rumble motors and the daemon never uses them. No DS4 code
path implements haptics at all: `DS4Controller` and `DS4HidRawController`
inherit the no-op `Controller.feedback()`, and `DS4EvdevController` inherits
`EvdevController.feedback`, whose entire body is a TODO docstring. So a profile
with Feedback Enabled on a DS4 is silently doing nothing -- the GUI offers the
setting, the modifier is stored, and the effect is dropped at the driver.

This is a gap rather than a regression; it has never worked.

The DS5 already does it (`ds5drv.feedback`), and the DS4's output report is the
same shape -- a small motor pair, `motor_left` heavy / `motor_right` light, with
a scheduled clear afterwards because the motors misbehave when shut off under
50 ms. That method is close to a template.

Two things to settle rather than copy blindly:

  - The DS5 halves the left motor's amplitude ("the left motor is heavier, so
    we must give it less oomph"). Whether the DS4's motors need the same
    correction is a hardware question, not something to assume.
  - The DS4 has three driver classes (HID, hidraw, evdev) and which one a pad
    gets depends on how it is connected, so the fix has to land somewhere all
    three reach, or be written three times.

Also worth doing at the same time: `Controller.rumble()` is still unimplemented
for the DS4 and DS5, so FF_RUMBLE's two magnitudes get averaged into one level
before they arrive. The heavy and light effects consequently feel identical on
both pads, where the hardware could tell them apart.

## Our own wiki, and the links that point at upstream's

Three user-facing links still go to C0rn3j's wiki, because that is where the
content actually is and this fork has none:

  - `scripts/sc-controller.appdata.xml`, `<url type="help">`
  - `glade/creg.glade` -- "Click here for more info" in Controller Registration,
    on evdev/HID mode for non-Steam controllers
  - `glade/global_settings.glade` -- using a phone with RetroArch as an
    additional controller

Repointing them now would send users somewhere empty, which is worse than
sending them somewhere foreign. So: set up a wiki on this repository, port or
rewrite those pages, and only then switch the links over.

Worth doing at the same time, since it is the same question of where a user is
sent for help: the fork's own pages will need to cover what has diverged --
the Steam Controller 2, the haptic effects, and the DS4/DS5 caveat that they
cannot be claimed exclusively over Bluetooth (see the README).

The donation URL in the AppStream metadata deliberately stays pointed at
upstream. This fork does not solicit donations.
